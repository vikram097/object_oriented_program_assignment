        "Encapsulation: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components to protect the integrity of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency by focusing on relevant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Allowing a new class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (parent class), promoting code reuse and establishing a relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while using overridden methods to perform different tasks. It allows for flexibility by enabling one interface to be used for a general class of actions.\n",

        "Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, representing an entity that combines both state (attributes) and behavior (methods)."

        "# Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python\n",
        "# The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes when there is inheritance. It is particularly important in cases of multiple inheritance, where a method or attribute can exist in more than one parent class. The MRO determines which method is invoked when called on an instance of the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Python follows the C3 linearization algorithm (also known as the C3 superclass linearization) to compute the MRO. This ensures that the method lookup is done in a consistent and predictable order, following a depth-first, left-to-right order for searching parent classes.\n",
        "# Key Points about MRO:\n",
        "# First, look at the class itself: Python checks if the method is defined in the class of the object itself.\n",
        "# Next, move to the first parent (in case of single inheritance) or left-most base class (in multiple inheritance).\n",
        "# Follow the chain up to the topmost base class, which is usually object, the ultimate ancestor of all classes in Python.\n",
        "# Retrieving the MRO Programmatically\n",
        "# You can retrieve the MRO of a class in Python using:\n",
        "\n",
        "# ClassName.__mro__: This returns a tuple showing the method resolution order of the class.\n",
        "# ClassName.mro(): This returns a list of the classes in the order Python will look through them for method resolution.\n",
